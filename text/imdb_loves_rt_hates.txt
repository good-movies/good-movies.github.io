In the Loop	2009	7.5	81	93	In the Loop is an uncommonly funny political satire that blends Dr. Strangelove with Spinal Tap for the Iraq war era.
About a Boy	2002	7.1	54	93	A winning comedy that benefits from Hugh Grant's boyish charms.
In Secret	2014	7.4	36	40	Although it benefits from a strong cast, In Secret's stars can't totally compensate for the movie's sodden pacing and overly familiar story.
Hollow Reed	1996	7.4	43	83	No consensus yet.
Chicken Little	2005	7.4	47	36	In its first non-Pixar CGI venture, Disney expends more effort in the technical presentation than in crafting an original storyline.

The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus	2009	7.2	60	64	Terry Gilliam remains as indulgent as ever, but The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus represents a return to the intoxicatingly imaginative, darkly beautiful power of his earlier work, with fine performances to match all the visual spectacle.

Front Page Woman	1935	7.2	27	80	No consensus yet.
First Descent	2005	7.2	85	52	This snowboarding doc scores with its dazzling array of snowboarding stunts and beautiful scenery, but loses points with shameless product placement and an overlong runtime.

The Ring	2002	7.1	48	71	With little gore and a lot of creepy visuals, The Ring gets under your skin, thanks to director Gore Verbinski's haunting sense of atmosphere and an impassioned performance from Naomi Watts.
The Flying Scotsman	2006	7.1	51	49	The Flying Scotsman's too-brisk pacing reduces the scale of cyclist Graham Obree's accomplishments while not uncovering what makes him tick.
Fugitive Pieces	2008	7.1	65	68	Though the retelling is a bit too subtle, the moving story and solid performances lift Fugitive Pieces beyond standard holocaust tales.

Contraband	1940	7.1	67	100	No consensus yet.
Chicken Run	2000	7.1	64	97	Chicken Run has all the charm of Nick Park's Wallace & Gromit, and something for everybody. The voice acting is fabulous, the slapstick is brilliant, and the action sequences are spectacular.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory	2005	7.1	51	82	Closer to the source material than 1971's Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is for people who like their Chocolate visually appealing and dark.
A.I. Artificial Intelligence	2001	7.1	64	73	A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism, A.I. is, in a word, fascinating.

The Keeping Room	2015	7.0	97	76	No consensus yet.
Special	2006	7.0	63	56	This quirky indie comedy's low budget is readily apparent, but it's elevated by Michael Rapaport's dedicated performance.
The Saint	1997	7.0	63	29	The Saint is watchable thanks to Kilmer and Shue, but the muddled screenplay stretches credulity.
Pee-wee's Big Adventure	1985	7.0	79	88	No consensus yet.
Orphan	2009	7.0	63	55	While it has moments of dark humor and the requisite scares, Orphan fails to build on its interesting premise and degenerates into a formulaic, sleazy horror/thriller.
My Dog Skip	2000	7.0	67	73	Critics say My Dog Skip is cute, wholesome entertainment for the family. It's especially designed to appeal to your sentiment, but you might find yourself choking up just the same.

Mean Girls	2004	7.0	66	83	Funnier and more smartly written than the average teen comedy.
Major Barbara	1941	7.0	54	85	No consensus yet.
Jerichow	2008	7.0	60	87	Minimal and intriguing, this Teutonic retreading of The Postman Always Rings Twice is tense and ominous throughout.
Hollywoodland	2006	7.0	47	68	More than a movie star murder mystery, Hollywoodland takes it slow in order to reveal the intriguing details of the rise and fall of superstar fame.
13 Rue Madeleine	1947	7.0	53	83	No consensus yet.
Private Parts	1997	6.8	68	79	A surprisingly endearing biopic about the controversial shock-jock Howard Stern that is equally funny and raunchy.

Visions of 8 - The Olympics of Motion Picture Achievement	1973	6.9	60	40	No consensus yet.
Vanilla Sky	2001	6.9	72	41	An ambitious mix of genres, Vanilla Sky collapses into an incoherent jumble. Cruise's performance lacks depth, and it's hard to feel sympathy for his narcissistic character.
The Majestic	2001	6.9	60	42	Ponderous and overlong, The Majestic drowns in forced sentimentality and resembles a mish-mash of other, better films.
The Hunchback of Notre Dame	1996	6.9	69	72	Disney's take on the Victor Hugo classic is dramatically uneven, but its strong visuals, dark themes, and message of tolerance make for a more-sophisticated-than-average children's film.
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe	2005	6.9	61	76	With first-rate special effects and compelling storytelling, this adaptation stays faithful to its source material and will please moviegoers of all ages.
The Ballad of Little Jo	1993	6.9	69	73	No consensus yet.
Take Me Home Tonight	2011	6.9	42	28	It has a charming sweetness about it, but Take Me Home Tonight is neither funny nor original enough to live up to the comedies it evokes.

Macon County Line	1974	6.9	59	33	No consensus yet.
Kingpin	1996	6.9	70	50	Kingpin has its moments, but they're often offset by an eagerness to descend into vulgar mean-spiritedness.

Cop Land	1997	6.9	66	72	No consensus yet.
Conan the Barbarian	1982	6.9	74	69	Though Conan may take itself too seriously for some, this adventure film about a former slave seeking vengeance is full of quotable Schwarzenegger lines and gritty action.
Calendar Girls	2003	6.9	67	74	A charming, but cliched comedy reminiscent of The Full Monty.
Breakdown	1997	6.9	66	80	A brainy and suspenseful -- if somewhat uneven -- thriller.
Basic Instinct	1992	6.9	63	54	Unevenly echoing the work of Alfred Hitchcock, Basic Instinct contains a star-making performance from Sharon Stone but is ultimately undone by its problematic, overly lurid plot.
Babe	1995	6.9	66	97	The rare family-friendly feature with a heart as big as its special effects budget, Babe offers timeless entertainment for viewers of all ages.
Aurora Borealis	2006	6.9	63	69	Deeply reminiscent of other, better films, Aurora Borealis nonetheless succeeds on the strength of winning performances from Sutherland and Jackson.
A Love Divided	1999	6.9	71	52	No consensus yet.
8 Mile	2002	6.9	54	76	Even though the story is overly familiar, there's enough here for an engaging ride.
Tomorrow Never Dies	1997	6.8	53	57	A competent, if sometimes by-the-numbers entry to the 007 franchise, Tomorrow Never Dies may not boast the most original plot but its action sequences are genuinely thrilling.

The Stone Boy	1984	6.8	41	80	No consensus yet.
The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear	1991	6.8	65	57	The slapstick antics of this sequel provide a few laughs, but fail to equal those of the original.
The House on 92nd Street	1945	6.8	50	60	No consensus yet.
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy	2005	6.8	65	60	A frantic and occasional funny adaptation of Douglas Adams' novel. However, it may have those unfamiliar with the source material scratching their heads.
The Curse of the Jade Scorpion	2001	6.8	54	45	The writing for Scorpion is not as sharp as Woody Allen's previous movies as most of the jokes fall flat.
Something New	2006	6.8	73	61	Something New tackles serious questions about race and interracial relationships with genuine appeal and an alluring romance that develops as naturally as the plot.
Pandorum	2009	6.8	48	28	While it might prove somewhat satisfying for devout sci-fi fans, Pandorum's bloated, derivative plot ultimately leaves it drifting in space.
One Last Thing	2006	6.8	61	11	No consensus yet.
One Hour Photo	2002	6.8	64	80	Robin Williams is very effective in this creepy, well-shot thriller.

Johnny Got His Gun	2008	6.8	50	21	No consensus yet.
Grace Is Gone	2007	6.8	60	61	A refreshing departure from the current crop of Iraq war dramas, Grace is Gone is a heartfelt, finely acted portrayal of grief and healing.

Dave	1993	6.8	71	94	Ivan Reitman's refreshingly earnest political comedy benefits from an understated, charming script and a breezy performance by Kevin Kline.
Bulworth	1998	6.8	68	75	Star and director Beatty's ambitious take on race and politics in 20th-century America isn't perfect, but manages to provide more than its share of thought-provoking laughs.

Beavis and Butt-head Do America	1996	6.8	70	72	Beavis and Butt-Head Do America is unabashedly offensive, unapologetically stupid, and unexpectedly funny.
Above Suspicion	1995	6.8	52	60	No consensus yet.
A Prairie Home Companion	2006	6.8	59	81	The final film by the great Robert Altman, A Prairie Home Companion, the big screen adaptation of Garrison Keillor's radio broadcast, showcases plenty of the director's strengths: it's got a gigantic cast and plenty of quirky acting and dialogue. Much like the radio show, Companion features clever jokes, rousing tunes, and endearing characters. With strong work from Lindsay Lohan, Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Tommy Lee Jones, it's a worthy swan song from one of the cinema's best.
A Goofy Movie	1995	6.8	70	53	No consensus yet.
8MM	1999	6.8	52	21	Its sadistic violence is unappealing and is lacking in suspense and mystery.
