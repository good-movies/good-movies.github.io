The Vow	2012	6.8	63	29	Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams do their best with what they're given, but The Vow is too shallow and familiar to satisfy the discriminating date-night filmgoer.

Max	2015	8.3	74	35	Max has good intentions and tries to hearken back to classic family-friendly features, but its disjointed, manipulative plot overwhelms the efforts of its talented human and canine stars.
Memoirs of a Geisha	2005	7.3	83	35	Less nuanced than its source material, Memoirs of a Geisha may be a lavish production, but it still carries the simplistic air of a soap opera.
Odd Thomas	2014	6.9	65	35	Anton Yelchin is the right man for the title role, but Odd Thomas suffers from a jumbled tone.
Radio	2003	6.9	80	35	The story is heavy on syrupy uplift and turns Radio into a saint/cuddly pet.

If I Stay	2014	6.8	62	36	Although Chlo  Grace Moretz gives it her all and the story adds an intriguing supernatural twist to its melodramatic YA framework, If I Stay is ultimately more manipulative than moving.
